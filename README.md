# Xenhat's OCI ublue Image

[![Build container image](https://github.com/XenHat/ublue-custom/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/XenHat/ublue-custom/actions/workflows/build.yml)

## Warning: Work in Progress

This image is primarily made for my laptop. It replaces Aurora's default DE
with Dank Material Shell atop Niri and adds a few packages I use every day.

TODO:

- [ ] Move intermediate states to a new image, i.e. after removing KDE
