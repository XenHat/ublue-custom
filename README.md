# Xenhat's ublue Image

## Warning: Work in Progress
[![Build container image](https://github.com/XenHat/ublue-custom/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/XenHat/ublue-custom/actions/workflows/build.yml)

An [Universal Blue](https://universal-blue.org/#cloud-native) image for my personal use. It replaces [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/)
with [Dank Material Shell](https://github.com/AvengeMedia/DankMaterialShell) atop [Niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri) and adds a few packages I use every day.

TODO:

- [ ] Move intermediate states to a new image, i.e. after removing KDE
